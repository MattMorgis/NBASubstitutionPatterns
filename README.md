# NBA Substitution Patterns

http://alexwainger.github.io/NBASubstitutionPatterns/

This project uses aggregated on-off data to visualize each team's substitution patterns dating back to the 2012-2013 season. The script runs once a week for the current season to keep the data relatively up-to-date.
